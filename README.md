# Latina Lingua
Made in 2017 by Maddie Burbage.

A Latin language-learning program, helping students master forming words.

Run latina.jar to execute the program. To start, choose whether adjectives or nouns are being tested. At the top of the next screen you can change your selection or refine which categories of words you'd like to test (which of the five noun declensions or the two adjective patterns to review). Nouns can also be further honed by their gender. After entering guesses for a word's endings and pressing "Grade", if all answers are correct a new word will be given. If there are any incorrect answers the grader will first inform the user how many are wrong, then highlight the wrong answers, and after three more tries the correct answers will be displayed. Grading accounts for macrons, so to insert one quickly the user can type alt + 'a' or whichever vowel they would like to enter. To review these hints, there is a help button in the bottom right of the screen.

The source dictionary of words is contained in the Adjectives.xml and Nouns.xml files. To add to the dictionary, add words to the files following the predefined format, including the name, declension, and stem of the word, and the gender if the word is a noun.

The grammar rules for the program are contained in AdjDeclensions.xml and Declensions.xml files, which shouldn't be modified for Latin grammar unless users want to insert special rules for irregular words.
